# MER Expo App

This project provides a cat food calculator built with React Native using Expo.
It mirrors the original web version, saving cat profiles and food data locally
so you can track daily calories even on mobile.

## Running

```
npm install
npx expo start
```

The calculation logic is shared with the test suite in `calculator.js`.
